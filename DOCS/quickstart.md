# Quickstart

Youâ€™ll need:

-    A video file with reasonably clear contrast (e.g. top-down fish or insect
    footage). Tracktor's adaptive thresholding makes it reasonably resilient to
    background disturbances especially when tracking one individual.

-    A parameter JSON file defining thresholds and filters for tracking (see
    example below for how to generate one)

Your python script will be as follows:

```python
import json
import time
import numpy as np
import tracktorlive as trl

# Load tracking parameters
with open("params.json") as f:
    params = json.load(f)
params["fps"] = 30.0

# Start a server to track one individual
server, semm = trl.spawn_trserver("video.mp4", params, n_ind=1, realtime=False)

# Start a client for real-time access to tracking data
client = trl.spawn_trclient(feed_id=server.feed_id)

# Define what the client should do each polling cycle
@client
def print_coords(data, clock):
    coords = data[0, :, -1] #the latest coordinates of the individual
    t = clock[-1] # latest timestamp
    if np.all(coords >= 0):
        print(f"t = {t:.2f}s, x = {coords[0]:.1f}, y = {coords[1]:.1f}")

# Run server and client together
trl.run_trsession(server, semm, client)

```

In this example, a TracktorServer handles all the tracking needed,
and using the print_coords casette, a client handles the response (in this case,
the response is simply 'always print the coordinates to a screen').
